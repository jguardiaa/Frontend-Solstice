                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Axial Tilt: Earth’s axis is an imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. It is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees from the vertical.</p>

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Seasons Overview:
                ● Earth experiences four seasons: spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter. The axial tilt causes different parts of Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year.</p>

                <h2 className="text-gray-900 dark:text-white text-3xl font-extrabold mb-2">Sunlight Distribution:</h2>
                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">When one hemisphere (Northern or Southern) is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer because it receives more direct sunlight.
                ● Conversely, when that hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, it experiences winter due to receiving less direct sunlight. </p>

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Type: Definition: An orbit is the path one celestial body takes as it moves around another. Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical (oval-shaped) path.
Key Facts:
● Distance from the Sun: The average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).
● Orbit Duration: It takes Earth approximately 365.25 days to complete one orbit around the Sun, which is why we have a leap year every four years to account for the extra quarter of a day.</p>

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Type: Terrestrial.
○ Size: About half the size of Earth.
○ Distance from Sun: Fourth planet.
○ Features:
■ Known as the "Red Planet" due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
■ Has the largest volcano (Olympus Mons) and canyon (Valles
Marineris) in the Solar System.
○ Moons: 2 (Phobos and Deimos).</p>

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">While Earth’s orbit affects the length of the year, it’s the axial tilt that primarily causes the seasonal changes. Earth’s distance from the Sun varies slightly during the year, but this has a minor effect on seasonal temperatures compared to the axial tilt.

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Definition: A solstice occurs when the Sun reaches its highest or lowest point in the sky at noon, resulting in the longest and shortest days of the year.
Types of Solstices:
1. Summer Solstice:
○ Occurs around June 21 in the Northern Hemisphere.
○ Longest day of the year; the Sun is directly overhead at noon at the Tropic of
Cancer (23.5° N).
2. Winter Solstice:
○ Occurs around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere.
○ Shortest day of the year; the Sun is directly overhead at noon at the Tropic of
Capricorn (23.5° S).

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Definition: An equinox occurs when day and night are approximately equal in length,
which happens when the Sun crosses the celestial equator.
Types of Equinoxes:
1. Spring (Vernal) Equinox:
○ Occurs around March 21.
○ Marks the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere.
2. Autumn (Fall) Equinox:
○ Occurs around September 23.
○ Marks the beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4"> Definition: Newton’s Laws of Motion are three fundamental principles that describe how objects move. They were formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century and are essential for understanding physics.</p>

                <h2 className="text-gray-900 dark:text-white text-3xl font-extrabold mb-2">The Three Laws:</h2>
                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">First Law: The Law of Inertia
○ Definition: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in
motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an external
force.
○ Example: A soccer ball won’t move unless someone kicks it, and once it’s
kicked, it will keep rolling until friction or another force stops it.
2. Second Law: The Law of Acceleration
○ Definition: The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied. It can be expressed with the formula: F=ma where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.
○ Example: Pushing a shopping cart (light) versus a car (heavy). It’s easier to accelerate the cart because it has less mass.
3. Third Law: The Law of Action and Reaction
○ Definition: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This
means that forces always occur in pairs.
○ Example: When you jump off a small boat, you push the boat backward while
moving forward.

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Definition: Gravity is a natural force that pulls objects with mass toward each other. The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them.</p>

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Gravitational Pull:
 
 ○ Every object with mass (like planets and stars) exerts a gravitational pull. The larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull.
 2. Orbits:
 ○ Planets orbit the Sun because of the gravitational pull between the Sun and
 the planets. The forward motion of the planets and the Sun’s gravitational pull create a balance, allowing them to travel in curved paths instead of falling into the Sun.

                <p className="text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">First Law: The Law of Ellipses
○ Definition: Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the two foci.
○ Explanation: This means that the distance between a planet and the Sun
changes as the planet travels along its orbit.
2. Second Law: The Law of Equal Areas
○ Definition: A line segment joining a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
○ Explanation: This means that a planet moves faster when it is closer to the Sun and slower when it is farther away.
3. Third Law: The Law of Harmonies
○ Definition: The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional
to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
○ Explanation: This means that planets farther from the Sun take longer to
orbit than those that are closer.
○ Formula: T2/a3=k
■ where T is the orbital period of the planet (in years)
■ a is the average distance from the Sun / the semi-major axis (in
astronomical units, AU)
■ k is a constant for all planets in the Solar System</p>
