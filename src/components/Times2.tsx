            <p className="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Thought to have been the last supernova clearly visible to humans in the Milky Way Galaxy, it was studied thoroughly by Johannes Kepler from 1604 to 1606, once it was no longer visible. At its brightest it reached a magnitude of -2.5, brighter than Jupiter and any star in the night sky. Kepler studied the phenomenon without the aid of telescopes, since they had not been invented yet.</p>

            <p className="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Galileo Galilei used his new telescope in 1610 to observe three different moons near Jupiter, at the time he thought they were distant stars, but as he looked at their proximity to Jupiter, and their relative movements, he came to the conclusion that they were moons orbiting the planet. His findings would go on to provide significant evidence towards the heliocentric model and disprove that everything orbited the earth..</p>

            <p className="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Now known as a dwarf planet, Ceres, was first discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi in 1801, and although he thought it was a comet at first, further analysis of its orbit led him to believe it was another planet in between Mars and Jupiter. However, as more and more similarly sized objects were discovered, William Herschel named these objects, including Ceres, asteroids.</p>
